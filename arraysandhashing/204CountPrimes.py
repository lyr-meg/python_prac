# time complexity O(sqrt(n)log(logn)+n), The +n is from calculating the answer after the main algorithm. The sqrt(n)
# â€‹comes from the outer loop. Each time we hit a prime, we "cross out" the multiples of that prime because we know they aren't prime. 
#   For 2, we have to cross out n/2 numbers.
#   For 3, we have to cross out n/3 numbers.
#   For 5, we have to cross out n/5 numbers.
#   ...etc for each prime less than n.
# n/2+n/3+... This is bounded by O(loglogn) 

# space complexity O(n), for the prime_indicator array
